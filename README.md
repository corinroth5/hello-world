# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

I'm Corin, an avid lover of the outdoors!  Currently, I'm in the process of completing my Master's degree in GIST at the University of Arizona.  I work for the Division of Emergency Management and have 3 teenage children!  We love hiking, camping, houseboating, skiing, backpacking, and riding rollercoasters!
